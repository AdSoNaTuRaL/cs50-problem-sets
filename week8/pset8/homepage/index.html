                <hr />
                <p>
                    I started studying the <mark>Javascript/Typescript</mark> stack - using technologies like <mark>React.js</mark>, <mark>Node.js</mark>, <mark>React Native</mark>,
                    <mark>PostgreSQL</mark>, <mark>MongoDB</mark> - in September 2020 and since then I have been doing small personal projects
                    using these technologies.
                    Before that I worked professionally (internship) with languages like <mark>PHP</mark> (pure and using the symfony
                    framework), <mark>Java</mark> for developing an API (using spring) and also <mark>SQL</mark> using <mark>MySQL</mark>.
                    Currently I am working on personal projects that use the languages mentioned at the beginning and
                    <mark>Flutter</mark> because my final master's work is about Flutter. So, I also have small projects in that technology
                    too.
                    Today, my professional goal is to become a software engineer who can help people with technology.

                        As an intern, working together with the other developers, I was able to assume some
                        responsibilities of developing new features for the company's system and fixing bugs (pure PHP
                        and using the Symfony framework), helping the most experienced developers to focus on the
                        main responsibilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I also helped the company to have more integrations with other companies (telecommunications
                        company) building an API using Java with Spring and Hibernate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improving customer contact with marketing team by integrating the company’s website
                        (WordPress) with a system of push notifications on web browser and mobile phones.

                    <li>
                        I helped public workers and tax auditors to improve their work optimizing tasks with new
                        features on system (doing requirements analysis and studying the problems of each one) or
                        simply using tech tools.

                    <li>
                        Working directly with public workers, understanding your problems and requirements, we were
                        able to improve the increase in financial income, helping them improve public services
