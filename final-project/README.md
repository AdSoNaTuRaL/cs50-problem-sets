<br />

## :question: How to use

### ðŸ’¢ If you want to use for English words, you need to create a config.js file inside ```synonyms-extension``` folder:

```javascript 
const urlCORS = 'YourCORSURLHere';
const UID = 'yourUIDHERE';
const tokenID = 'yourTokenIDHere';
```

> For the CORS URL you should check https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere

> For UID and tokenID you should check https://www.synonyms.com/synonyms_api.php

### ðŸ’¢ If you want to use only for Portuguese words, just check the checkbox (it already recognizes your browser's language and automatically ticks the checkbox)
